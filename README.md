##Introduction

Welcome to Bikini Bottom! Our SimCity models Bikini Bottom from the show Spongebob Squarepants. All images are taken from the show and are not intended to be original art.

##Our Buildings
Picture | Building | Developer | 
--- | --- | ---
![Restaurant](img/krusty_krab.png) | Restaurant | Erik
![Bank](img/bank.png) | Bank | Jack
![Market](img/market.png) | Market | Anthony
![House](img/pineapple_house.png) | Apartment | Zach
![Hospital](img/hospital.png) | Hospital | Victoria
![Busstop](img/bus_stop.png) | Busstop | Diego

##Our GUI
Bikini Bottom comes with an integrated person creation panel. Click in a hospital to pull it up. Here the user may spawn people with certain names and select roles and residences. Hours are displayed in the info panel after clicking on the building. Special event such as opening, closing, charging residents, and housing degredation occurs at certain times (specified in building info panels).

![GUI Fields](img/guiFields.png)

Our creation panel has two buttons. The "Create" button creates one person with the selected attributes. The "Populate selected workplace" button creates enough people to fill all jobs in the selected workplace, giving them the default attributes and a residence. You may also mix and match combo boxes to create the proper scenario.

###Scenarios
+ Select the building you would like to observe in the combo box
+ Click "populate building" to create people to fill the building's roles
+ Click on the proper building to see what happens within
+ Lower building numbers correspond to buildings to the top and left

###Gui Details
+ The small green squares are citizens of Bikini Bottom walking through the streets
+ The small triangles at the corners of buildings are bus stops, while the larger yellow squares are the buses themselves. Citizens take a bus if they're not assigned a car or are going very far away.
+ The red large squares are cars. Citizens drive cars if they are assigned cars in the creation panel.

##How to run our system
You will create enough people to cover every employment spot in the city. This is easily done by selecting "All" in the workplace field and pressing the "Populate selected workplace" button. People will the go around living their lives, making decisions based on the time and their attributes.

##Miscellaneous Information
+ Poor people always eat at home. 
+ If they are not poor they can go to the closest restaurant. 
+ People might own a place but live in another.
+ Markets run out of products and can be restocked through GUI.
+ Rents are paid daily

##Unfulfilled requirements
+ (Done) We only have apartments, not houses, because we need enough housing to accommodate a large number of people.
+ (Done) We only have one type of restaurant in our town.
+ Restaurant excess money is not being deposited in a Bank.
+ (Done) We are not incorporating Shared Data between Cook and Waiter.
+ (Done) Bank Accounts can be negative.
+ (Done) Restaurants do not order to markets remotely, instead, they use a v2.2 type of market.
+ (Done) There should be different behavior on weekends.
+ (Done) Buses sometimes get stuck at intersections
